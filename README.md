# Pokémon Library (PokeDex)

Live demo: [https://AmarKoonar.github.io/Pokemon_Library](https://AmarKoonar.github.io/Pokemon_Library)

This is a simple Pokédex-style web app built using **React** and **Bootstrap**. It displays a list of Pokémon with styling based on their types. I created this project as a way to test out various design ideas, layout approaches, and experiment with dynamic UI concepts using Bootstrap and modular CSS.

## 🚀 Features

Also install Bootstrap if not already included:
